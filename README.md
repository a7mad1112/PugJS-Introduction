## Getting Started
Getting Started with Pug JS - Step by Step Guide
### Installation
- Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.
  You can download and install Node.js from the official website [nodejs](https://nodejs.org).
- Open your terminal or command prompt and verify that Node.js is installed by running the command: 'node -v'
- Once Node.js is successfully installed, you can install Pug globally by running the command: 'npm install -g pug'

### Create a Project Directory
- Create a new directory for your Pug project. 
  You can choose any suitable name for your project.
- Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory using the 'cd' command.

### Initialize a Node.js Project
- In the project directory, initialize a new Node.js project by running the command: 'npm init'
- Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information for your project, or you can use the default values by pressing Enter for each prompt.

### Install Pug as a Project Dependency
- With your Node.js project initialized, you can install Pug as a project dependency by running the command: 'npm install pug'

### Create a Pug Template
- Inside your project directory, create a new file with a .pug extension. 
  This file will serve as your Pug template.
- Open the Pug template file in a text editor and start writing Pug code.

### Write Pug Code
- Pug uses indentation-based syntax instead of HTML tags.
- Write Pug code to define the structure, content, and logic of your HTML template.

### Compile Pug to HTML
- In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.
- Run the command to compile your Pug template to HTML: 'pug &lt;template-file&gt; -o &lt;output-directory&gt;'
- Replace '&lt;template-file&gt;' with the path of your Pug template file.
- Replace '&lt;output-directory&gt;' with the path to the directory where you want the compiled HTML file to be generated.
- 

### View the Compiled HTML
- Open the compiled HTML file in a web browser to see the result of your Pug template.
### Make Changes and Repeat
- Edit your Pug template file to make any changes to the HTML structure or content.
- Run the Pug compiler again to generate the updated HTML output.
- Refresh the web browser to view the changes.

Great job on getting started with Pug JS! &hearts;
